# Graduation Benchmark Calculator
This website has been set up to aid students from the University of Warwick calculate their Graduation Benchmark (Safety Net), using the formulas provided by the university. This has been set up as it can be confusing to calculate your achievements for the current year, and thus your safety net. Hopefully this website is able to help someone.</br>

It has been written in plain html/css/js using the Bulma framework for CSS. JS libraries used are Chart.js, and JQuery. As this was built in 24h the code is not optimised to the best degree but due to the nature of the data being processed, this is not a major issue.

## TODO
- Add second year calculator
- Verify third year intermediate calculator
